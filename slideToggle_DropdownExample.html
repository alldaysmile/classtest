  /* Hi Son, to use the function slideToggle the container that you are using slideToggle with (in this case #hidden) it must be set to display none to get the dropdown menu effect you are looking for. Notice on line 13 how #hidden is set to display none. you should play with this display settings and see what kind of effect it has on the animation */

$("#clickMe").click(function(){// on this line we are setting an event listener. A listener listening for a "click" function on a container with the id of "clickme"
  $('#hidden').slideToggle("slow");//on this line we are telling our event listener that when someone clicks on #clickme that we will animate the div #hidden

  // in reference to your original question can you use slideDown to toggle your dropdown menu. I currently have this function commented on the line below. If you want to play with these different effects comment line 35 (with two //) and leave line 38 uncommented
  //$('#hidden').slideDown("slow");
